# Raspberry Pi Measurement Kernel

Bare minimum Kernel for the Raspberry Pi to examine memory chips via SPI. Currently being used as a ReRAM-based TRNG.

## Setup

See [the setup documentation](doc/Setup.md)!

<!--# Citing

The BibTeX snippet below is the recommended way to cite this project.

Further research on the TRNG itself has been made in several works. Many of them can be found [here](https://nmexis.me/#research-and-publications) (along with [BibTeX code](https://femtopedia.de/research/) to cite them).

- `boot/` is the target directory for all the files that will need to be copied to an SD card. This folder will contain files that are taken directly from [raspberrypi/firmware](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware)

- `circle/` is a submodule that includes [Rene Stange](https://github.com/rsta2)'s [circle](https://github.com/rsta2/circle) framework, which provides all the bare metal driver implementations we need
- `Makefile` is a modified version of the Makefile that [Rene Stange](https://github.com/rsta2)'s [circle](https://github.com/rsta2/circle) framework suggests
- `doc/Wiring*` files have been generated using [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/)
- `mt19937ar*` files are modified versions of Takuji Nishimura's and Makoto Matsumoto's [Mersenne Twister implementation](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/m-mat/MT/MT2002/emt19937ar.html)
